# hello-world
This repository is for practice of GitHub
I am new to GitHub and new to coding. I was in the military for 11 years and did a career change.   
I've only had an intro class in C++ and now learning  Java and Python.  
I am nowhere near where I should be, but I am enjoying learning what I can and taking it one step at a time.
